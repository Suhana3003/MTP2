            <div class="content-text paragraphs">Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health disorder that begins after a traumatic event. That event may involve a real or perceived threat of injury or death.
    <br>People with PTSD have intense, disturbing thoughts and feelings related to their experience that last long after the traumatic event has ended. They may relive the event through flashbacks or nightmares; they may feel sadness, fear or anger; and they may feel detached or estranged from other people. People with PTSD may avoid situations or people that remind them of the traumatic event, and they may have strong negative reactions to something as ordinary as a loud noise or an accidental touch.
                    <br><br>This can include:<br>
                    <ul class="ptsd-list">
                        <li>a natural disaster like an earthquake or tornado</li>
                        <li>military combat</li>
                        <li>physical or sexual assault or abuse</li>
                        <li>an accident</li>
